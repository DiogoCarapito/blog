This summer was **rough**.

The beguining was going well.
I finished my [project](https://github.com/DiogoCarapito/predictive_methods_project_nova_ims/) for **Predictive Methods of Data Mining** at [NOVA IMS](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/). I'm pretty happy with the results. We ended up used streamlit, and we got a pretty good score on Kaggle with our rather simple neural network. =D  
I also watched the [LLM Bootcamp 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvxaj6pHeVA), which gave me a lot of insight on the current state of LLMs. 

But my side projects were slowing down. 
I guess I was able to picture a structure in my head that might work (front end, backend's data flow, data storage, RAG adn LLM inteerface) but I was having trouble implementing it.

But what threw me off was a course I attended: **Healthcare NLP for Data Scientists** on July 19-20, 2023 from [John Snow Labs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/).
Don't get me wrong, the course was great, I will need to revisit for sure, but it made me realize that I was lacking solid foundations ML, NLP and as a data scientist in general. 

It took me the rest of the summer to figure out **what to do next**.

And to gather ***motivation*** to do it.

I realized that **MLOps** might be the solution I was looking for, thanks to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvxaj6pHeVA) from Noah Gift 
I ended up enrolling in the **Coursera's [MLOps | Machine Learning Operations Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke)**.
I'm currently finishing the 2rd course. Pretty good so far!

**DevOps** concepts are helping to be more consistent and efficient in my work.

I'm more agile working with the **command line** and **github**. 

I'm tipping my toes in Docker, AWS and Rust.

I'm even starting to realize that I might be need to create a **python library** for my data visualization projects, so i can replicate with ease the reports i've been doing for my clinical context.

Let's push through the rest of the year!
