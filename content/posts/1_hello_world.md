I’ve been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between health and tech (NLP and LLMs, I’m looking at you).
There is so much potential and I have so many ideas!

So, lately I’ve been:
- grinding through **[fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSvpQjSnJJ_PmDQB_VyT5iU)** (just finished the 4th lesson this week)
- exploring **website domain name** stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPI’s exploration tool, **[mgfhub.com](mgfhub.com)**)
- reconnecting to social media (I’ve been away for a while now), setting up linkedin, twitter and joining relevant discord servers
- after completing **[Postgraduate Program in Information Management and Business Intelligence in Healthcare](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/education/programs/postgraduate-programs-and-master-degree-programs/postgraduate-program-in-information-management-and-business-intelligence-in-healthcare/)** @NOVA IMS, I felt the need to keep learning about data mining, so i’m doing a single course on Predictive Methods of Data Mining
- exploring DL, ML, NLP and LLM main concepts and recent developments (looking at you [chatbase.co](https://www.chatbase.co/), [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) and [Quarto Help Bot](https://quarto-bot.onrender.com/))
- trying and failing implementing LLMs with jupyter notebooks
- exploring how to start a blog (thanks fast.ai for the push!)

Initially I thought implementing a blog with **Dash** and publish it on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), since I’ve worked with Flask in the past months.
But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.

During fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), but seems that the project has been discontinued.

I found [REPL Notes](https://replnotes.com/), it had a pretty and simple solution.
It seems that the paid version wasn’t functioning right and it was too strict for personalization.

I ended up with fastpages’ sucessor [quatro.org](https://quarto.org/).
It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap).
It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available.
cool B-)

That’s what I appreciate most: **eficient implementation and task automation that saves time**.

I’m super exited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!).
Now that I have finished implementing my blog, I can check it out from my to-do list:)
