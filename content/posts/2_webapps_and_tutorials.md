This week has been exiting.
I have this **NLP project** cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.

For the backend I’ve been cruising through **[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)**, **[LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)** and **OpenAI API**, thanks to tutorials form **[James Briggs](https://www.youtube.com/@jamesbriggs)** and **[Data independent](https://www.youtube.com/@DataIndependent)**.
Google colab has been my best friend.

Even though the backend is the new exiting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented.
The frontend must:
- use Pyhton as main language
- have a fast learning curve and easy development 
- produce a clean, intuitive and beautiful tool

I started with **Flask/Dash** vs **Django**, and after some thought, since i have built with it before, I picked Dash. I ended up building a scafold, the development was faster this time arround but it required some hardcode. The result was OK but not stunning. Dash is pretty taxing on layout and design. I deployed it on render (that was a first :smile:)

Last night I discovered **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**.
I was captivated by it’s beauty and simplicity and ended up creating a simple scafolding witht he help of [Fanilo](https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo), [Misra Turp](https://www.youtube.com/@misraturp) and [Coding Is Fun](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingIsFun) tutorials.

This morning I stumbled again on [Pynecone](https://pynecone.io/) (different pinecone) and I was amazed (thanks to NeuralNine’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4fCNMPp0I)), it seem to a have all I need for my simple implementation.
It’s on alpha stage, but I guess I’ll give it a try.

If that wasn’t enought, it seems that [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) can also serve as a framework for a webapp.
This will be fun…

I’m not sure what framework will I end up with.
Let’s keep going!

Some stuff I found useful this week:

- [emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) - emoji code list
- [https://cssgradient.io/](https://cssgradient.io/) - tool to create gradients
- [Data Color Picker](https://www.learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette) - Palette, Single Hue and Divergent color generators
