Last time I posted a blog post I went nuts to make it work.
I couldn't remember how to publish a post.
I don't know what it was, maybe guithub pages, maybe the quarto framework, but definitly my dumbness was a big part of it.
I just can't grasp yet **how** all this **unintuitive git shenanigans works**.
So I've been postponing my new blog post knowing what awaited me.

Meanwhile, I remembered a friend of mine **[InÃªs Pereira](https://inespereira.me/)** had a blog with the same pourpouse, and it crossed my eyes another blog **[https://notadoctor.me/](https://notadoctor.me/)** that used looked like hers.
They both look **sleek** and **simple**.
And both are made with **[hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**.
So i dug in.

Hugo seems to be a static site generator, that uses markdown files to generate html pages.
It's fast, it's simple, it's easy to use.

Even though the setting up part was not that easy as promised (**why can everything work like python?**), I ended up with a better looking site.
I't seems customizable enough to fuss arround in the future if i need. 

I'll have some news soon, since i've already delivering my project on [Predictive Methods of Data Mining @NOVA IMS](https://guia.unl.pt/en/2022/novaims/program/94342/course/200166).
I've been watching seminars/conferences on youtube regarding MLops ans LLMs and i'm exited to share some of my thoughts. 


*lets publish this and see if it works ;)*

Btw, thanks [david hwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QSr2_pxIJs) for your tutorial on publishing with gihub pages.
