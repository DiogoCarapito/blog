Last time I posted a blog post, I almost went nuts to make it work.
I couldn't remember how to publish a post.
I don't know what it was, maybe guithub pages, maybe the quarto framework, but definitly my dumbness was a big part of it.
I just can't grasp yet **how** all this **unintuitive git shenanigans work**.
So I've been postponing my new blog post, knowing what awaited me.

Meanwhile, I remembered a friend of mine, **[InÃªs Pereira](https://inespereira.me/)**, had a blog with the same purpose, and it crossed my eyes another blog **[https://notadoctor.me/](https://notadoctor.me/)** that looked like hers.
They both look **sleek** and **simple**.
And both are made with **[hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**.
So I dug in.

Hugo seems to be a static site generator, that uses markdown files to generate html pages.
It's fast, it's simple, it's easy to use.

Even though the setting up part was not as easy as promised (**why can everything work like python?**), I ended up with a better looking site.
It seems customizable enough to fuss around in the future if needed. 

I'll have some news soon, since I've already delivered my project on [Predictive Methods of Data Mining @NOVA IMS](https://guia.unl.pt/en/2022/novaims/program/94342/course/200166).
I've been watching seminars/conferences on youtube regarding MLops and LLMs and I'm exited to share some of my thoughts. 


*Let's publish this and see if it works ;)*

Btw, thanks [david hwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QSr2_pxIJs) for your **tutorial** on publishing **hugo sites with github pages**.
