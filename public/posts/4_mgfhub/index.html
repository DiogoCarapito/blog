        <h1>mgfhub.com is now live!</h1>
        <div><p>I&rsquo;m excited to announce that <strong><a href="https://mgfhub.com">mgfhub.com</a></strong> is now live!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a search tool with data visualization components for <strong>KPIs</strong> (&ldquo;indicadores&rdquo;) that exists in Portuguese Primary Care.
I have imagined it for more than a year, and it&rsquo;s trying to <strong>answer questions</strong> that I have in my daily life as a Family Medicine Resident when I&rsquo;m working with KPIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How many KPIs exist?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do KPIs work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to quickly find specific KPIs (<em>e.g. which KPIs are related to diabetes?</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s the impact of each KPI in the main performance index (&ldquo;IDG&rdquo;)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Information was scattered in different places.
I ended up scrapping the data from the official platform (<strong><a href="https://sdm.min-saude.pt/BI.aspx?id=001&amp;CLUSTERS=S">SDM</a></strong>) and creating a database with all the information I needed.
I merged the info with the official documentation and created a webapp.</p>
<p>The information is displayed in <strong>table</strong> form, with filters and a search bar using basic fuzzy logic search. There is an alternate card form with some graphics too.</p>

<p>There is also a <strong>sunburst</strong> chart to visualize the weight of each KPI in the main performance index (IDG).</p>

<p>I used <strong><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/">Flask</a></strong> as my framework, <strong><a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Dash</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/">Bootstrap</a></strong> to make it pretty.
I hosted it on <strong><a href="https://render.com/">Render</a></strong> and I used <strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a></strong> to manage the domain (even though for my subsequent projects I ended up using <strong><a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a></strong>, it&rsquo;s way simpler and close to the same price).</p>
<p>There are still some rough edges, it&rsquo;s a work in progress, but I&rsquo;m happy with what I&rsquo;ve accomplished so far.</p>
