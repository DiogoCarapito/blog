There is so much potential and I have so many ideas!
So, lately I’ve been:

grinding through fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders (just finished the 4th lesson this week)
exploring website domain name stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPIs exploration tool, mgfhub.com)
reconnecting to social media (I’ve been away for a while now), setting up linkedin, twitter and joining relevant discord servers
after completing Postgraduate Program in Information Management and Business Intelligence in Healthcare @NOVA IMS, I felt the need to keep learning about data mining, so i’m doing a single course on Predictive Methods of Data Mining
exploring DL, ML, NLP and LLM main concepts and recent developments (looking at you chatbase.co, ChatPDF and Quarto Help Bot)
trying and failing implementing LLMs with jupyter notebooks
exploring how to start a blog (thanks fast.ai for the push!)

Initially I thought implementing a blog with Dash and publish it on pythonanywhere.com, since I’ve worked with Flask in the past months.
But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://diogocarapito.com/posts/1_hello_world/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://diogocarapito.com/posts/1_hello_world/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://diogocarapito.com/posts/1_hello_world/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="diogo carapito"><meta property="og:title" content="hello, world!"><meta property="og:description" content="I’ve been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between health and tech (NLP and LLMs, I’m looking at you).
