        <h1>hugo</h1>
        <div><p>Last time I posted a blog post, I almost went nuts to make it work.
I couldn&rsquo;t remember how to publish a post.
I don&rsquo;t know what it was, maybe guithub pages, maybe the quarto framework, but definitly my dumbness was a big part of it.
I just can&rsquo;t grasp yet <strong>how</strong> all this <strong>unintuitive git shenanigans work</strong>.
So I&rsquo;ve been postponing my new blog post, knowing what awaited me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I remembered a friend of mine, <strong><a href="https://inespereira.me/">InÃªs Pereira</a></strong>, had a blog with the same purpose, and it crossed my eyes another blog <strong><a href="https://notadoctor.me/">https://notadoctor.me/</a></strong> that looked like hers.
They both look <strong>sleek</strong> and <strong>simple</strong>.
And both are made with <strong><a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a></strong>.
So I dug in.</p>
<p>Hugo seems to be a static site generator, that uses markdown files to generate html pages.
It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s easy to use.</p>
<p>Even though the setting up part was not as easy as promised (<strong>why can everything work like python?</strong>), I ended up with a better looking site.
It seems customizable enough to fuss around in the future if needed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have some news soon, since I&rsquo;ve already delivered my project on <a href="https://guia.unl.pt/en/2022/novaims/program/94342/course/200166">Predictive Methods of Data Mining @NOVA IMS</a>.
I&rsquo;ve been watching seminars/conferences on youtube regarding MLops and LLMs and I&rsquo;m exited to share some of my thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s publish this and see if it works ;)</em></p>
<p>Btw, thanks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QSr2_pxIJs">david hwang</a> for your <strong>tutorial</strong> on publishing <strong>hugo sites with github pages</strong>.</p>
