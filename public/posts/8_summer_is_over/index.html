        <h1>Summer is over! Time to MLOps</h1>
        <div><p>This summer was <strong>rough</strong>.</p>
<p>The beguining was going well.
I finished my <a href="https://github.com/DiogoCarapito/predictive_methods_project_nova_ims/">project</a> for <strong>Predictive Methods of Data Mining</strong> at <a href="https://www.novaims.unl.pt/">NOVA IMS</a>. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the results. We ended up used streamlit, and we got a pretty good score on Kaggle with our rather simple neural network. =D<br>
I also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvxaj6pHeVA">LLM Bootcamp 2023</a>, which gave me a lot of insight on the current state of LLMs.</p>
<p>But my side projects were slowing down.
I guess I was able to picture a structure in my head that might work (front end, backend&rsquo;s data flow, data storage, RAG adn LLM inteerface) but I was having trouble implementing it.</p>
<p>But what threw me off was a course I attended: <strong>Healthcare NLP for Data Scientists</strong> on July 19-20, 2023 from <a href="https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/">John Snow Labs</a>.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the course was great, I will need to revisit for sure, but it made me realize that I was lacking solid foundations ML, NLP and as a data scientist in general.</p>
<p>It took me the rest of the summer to figure out <strong>what to do next</strong>.</p>
<p>And to gather <em><strong>motivation</strong></em> to do it.</p>
<p>I realized that <strong>MLOps</strong> might be the solution I was looking for, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvxaj6pHeVA">this video</a> from Noah Gift
I ended up enrolling in the <strong>Coursera&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke">MLOps | Machine Learning Operations Specialization</a></strong>.
I&rsquo;m currently finishing the 2rd course. Pretty good so far!</p>
<p><strong>DevOps</strong> concepts are helping to be more consistent and efficient in my work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more agile working with the <strong>command line</strong> and <strong>github</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dipping my toes in Docker, AWS and Rust.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even starting to realize that I might be need to create a <strong>python library</strong> for my data visualization projects, so i can replicate with ease the reports i&rsquo;ve been doing for my clinical context.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s push through the rest of the year!</p>
