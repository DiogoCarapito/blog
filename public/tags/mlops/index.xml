      <description>This summer was rough.
The beguining was going well. I finished my project for Predictive Methods of Data Mining at NOVA IMS. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the results. We ended up used streamlit, and we got a pretty good score on Kaggle with our rather simple neural network. =D
I also watched the LLM Bootcamp 2023, which gave me a lot of insight on the current state of LLMs.
But my side projects were slowing down.</description>
