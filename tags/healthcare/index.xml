      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that mgfhub.com is now live!
It&amp;rsquo;s as a sort of &amp;ldquo;data visualization &amp;quot; for KPI&amp;rsquo;s (indicadores) in Portuguese Primary Care. I imagined it for more than a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s trying to answer questions that I have in my day to day work:
How many do exist?
How do this KPI&amp;rsquo;s work
How to find specific KPI&amp;rsquo;s (eg: which are related to diabetes?)
What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of each KPI in the main performance index (IDG)?</description>

      <description>This week has been exiting. I have this NLP project cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.
For the backend I’ve been cruising through Pinecone, LangChain and OpenAI API, thanks to tutorials form James Briggs and Data independent. Google colab has been my best friend.
Even though the backend is the new exiting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented.</description>
