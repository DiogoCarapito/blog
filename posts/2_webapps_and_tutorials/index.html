        <h1>webapps and tutorials</h1>
        <div><p>This week has been exciting.
I have this <strong>NLP project</strong> cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.</p>
<p>For the backend, I’ve been cruising through <strong><a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">LangChain</a></strong> and <strong>OpenAI API</strong>, thanks to tutorials from <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jamesbriggs">James Briggs</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DataIndependent">Data independent</a></strong>.
Google colab has been my best friend.</p>
<p>Even though the backend is the new exciting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented.
The frontend must:</p>
<ul>
<li>use Pyhton as main language</li>
<li>have a fast learning curve and easy development</li>
<li>produce a clean, intuitive and beautiful tool</li>
</ul>
<p>I started with <strong>Flask/Dash</strong> vs <strong>Django</strong>, and after some thought, since I have built with it before, I picked Dash. I ended up building a scaffold, the development was faster this time around but it required some hardcode. The result was OK but not stunning. Dash is pretty taxing on layout and design. I deployed it on render (that was a first!)</p>
<p>Last night I discovered <strong><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a></strong>.
I was captivated by its beauty and simplicity and ended up creating a simple scaffolding with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo">Fanilo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@misraturp">Misra Turp</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodingIsFun">Coding Is Fun</a> tutorials.</p>
<p>This morning I stumbled again on <a href="https://pynecone.io/">Pynecone</a> (different pinecone) and I was amazed (thanks to NeuralNine’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur4fCNMPp0I">video</a>), it seem to have all I need for my simple implementation.
It’s on alpha stage, but I guess I’ll give it a try.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough, it seems that <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> can also serve as a framework for a webapp.
This will be fun…</p>
<p>I’m not sure what framework I will end up with.
Let’s keep going!</p>
