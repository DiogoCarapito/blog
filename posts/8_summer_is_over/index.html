I finished my project for Predictive Methods of Data Mining at NOVA IMS. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the results. We ended up used streamlit, and we got a pretty good score on Kaggle with our rather simple neural network. =D
I also watched the LLM Bootcamp 2023, which gave me a lot of insight on the current state of LLMs.
But my side projects were slowing down.
I guess I was able to picture a structure in my head that might work (front end, backend&rsquo;s data flow, data storage, RAG adn LLM inteerface) but I was having trouble implementing it."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://diogocarapito.com/posts/8_summer_is_over/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://diogocarapito.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://diogocarapito.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://diogocarapito.com/posts/8_summer_is_over/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://diogocarapito.com/posts/8_summer_is_over/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="diogo carapito"><meta property="og:title" content="Summer is over!
