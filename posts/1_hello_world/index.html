        <h1>hello, world!</h1>
        <div><p>I’ve been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between health and tech (NLP and LLMs, I’m looking at you).
There is so much potential and I have so many ideas!</p>
<p>So, lately I’ve been:</p>
<ul>
<li>grinding through <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&amp;list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSvpQjSnJJ_PmDQB_VyT5iU">fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a></strong> (just finished the 4th lesson this week)</li>
<li>exploring <strong>website domain name</strong> stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPIs exploration tool, <strong><a href="mgfhub.com">mgfhub.com</a></strong>)</li>
<li>reconnecting to social media (I’ve been away for a while now), setting up linkedin, twitter and joining relevant discord servers</li>
<li>after completing <strong><a href="https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/education/programs/postgraduate-programs-and-master-degree-programs/postgraduate-program-in-information-management-and-business-intelligence-in-healthcare/">Postgraduate Program in Information Management and Business Intelligence in Healthcare</a></strong> @NOVA IMS, I felt the need to keep learning about data mining, so i’m doing a single course on Predictive Methods of Data Mining</li>
<li>exploring DL, ML, NLP and LLM main concepts and recent developments (looking at you <a href="https://www.chatbase.co/">chatbase.co</a>, <a href="https://www.chatpdf.com/">ChatPDF</a> and <a href="https://quarto-bot.onrender.com/">Quarto Help Bot</a>)</li>
<li>trying and failing implementing LLMs with jupyter notebooks</li>
<li>exploring how to start a blog (thanks fast.ai for the push!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially I thought implementing a blog with <strong>Dash</strong> and publish it on <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">pythonanywhere.com</a>, since I’ve worked with Flask in the past months.
But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.</p>
<p>During fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a>, but seems that the project has been discontinued.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://replnotes.com/">REPL Notes</a>, it had a pretty and simple solution.
It seems that the paid version wasn’t functioning right and it was too strict for personalization.</p>
<p>I ended up with fastpages’ sucessor <a href="https://quarto.org/">quatro.org</a>.
It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap).
It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available.
cool B-)</p>
<p>That’s what I appreciate the most: <strong>efficient implementation and task automation that saves time</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m super excited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!).
Now that I have finished implementing my blog, I can check it out from my to-do list:)</p>
