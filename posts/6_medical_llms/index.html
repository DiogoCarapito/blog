        <h1>Medical Large Language Models</h1>
        <div><p>I attended last week the <strong>Medical Large Language Models for Clinical Text Summarization, Information Extraction, and Question Answering</strong> from <a href="https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/">John Snow Labs</a>.
I&rsquo;m sharing my notes here.</p>
<h1 id="llms">LLMs</h1>
<p>LLMs and NLP in general are providing new tools to solve existing problems in healthcare.
Here is a list of some new tools that are available today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question Answering</li>
<li>Text Summarization</li>
<li>Text Generation</li>
<li>Information extraction (<em>e.g.</em> from clinical notes)</li>
<li>Relation extraction (<em>e.g.</em> symptoms related to a disease)</li>
<li>Entity recognition (like ICD-10 code extraction)</li>
<li>Chatbots</li>
</ul>
<p>Many open source LLMs available today have close performance to the best commercial state-of-the-art models, like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo form OpenAI or Claude from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude">Anthropic</a>.
The last tend to be general purpose, powerful, but extremely expensive to train.
The open source models tend to lack performance in a broad sense but can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
This field is moving fast, which means that there is much potential for innovation, but it&rsquo;s also a challenge to keep up with the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of <strong>tasks</strong> that <strong>Medical LLMs</strong> can perform today:</p>
<h1 id="llms-in-healthcare">LLMs in Healthcare</h1>
<h3 id="1-close-book-qa">1. Close book Q&amp;A:</h3>
<p>Question answering using <a href="https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/04/18/biogpt_chat_jsl_conversational_en.html">BioGPT JSL</a> as the base model and a knowledge base.</p>
<p><em>demo available here: <a href="https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/MEDICAL_LLM/">https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/MEDICAL_LLM/</a></em></p>
<h3 id="2-medical-text-generation">2. Medical text generation</h3>
<p><a href="https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/2023/04/18/biogpt_chat_jsl_conversational_en.html">BioGPT JSL</a> can also be used to generate text,
like an elaborate response to a more open question,
creating synthetic text or even synthetic patients.

<p><em>(nice implementation with <a href="https://streamlit.io/">streamlit</a> btw)</em></p>
<h3 id="3-clinical-text-summarization">3. Clinical text Summarization</h3>
<p>One of the <strong>most popular</strong> uses of LLMs in medical field is <strong>clinical summarization</strong>.
An obvious use case is to summarize a <strong>patient&rsquo;s medical history</strong>, since it can get very long and have repeated information.
This summarization has its own specificities, like the need to <strong>preserve the medical terminology</strong> and the need to <strong>preserve the order of events</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="4-biomedical-research-text-summarization">4. Biomedical Research text Summarization</h3>
<p>A tool to help dealing with the avalanche of new research papers that are being published.
It makes it easier to automate the process of reading and summarizing the papers.</p>
<h3 id="5-patient-question-text-summarization">5. Patient Question text Summarization</h3>
<p>A way to outline the patient&rsquo;s question to the doctor, so that the doctor can quickly understand the patient&rsquo;s concern.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/post_images/6_patient_questions.png" alt="patient question text"  />
</p>
<h1 id="no-code-medical-chatbots">No-Code Medical Chatbots</h1>
<p>Another interesting concept is <strong>no-code implementations</strong> that JSL are developing,
available at <a href="https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/nlp-lab/">https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/nlp-lab/</a>.</p>
<p>It can be used to create <strong>natural language interfaces</strong> to query databases, of both clinical records and biomedical research.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/post_images/6_query_serch.png" alt="query search"  />
</p>
<p>This seems very interesting to apply in a <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> + <strong>healthcare</strong> context.
The user could help accelarate the adoption of BI practices in the field and make it more widespread.</p>
<p>Three key requirements were proposed to <strong>comply</strong> these chatbots <strong>with current regulations</strong> (like new legislation that is being currently discussed in EU parliament).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Data Sharing</strong>: Clinical data is sensitive. No data is shared through cloud, APIs and 3rd parties. Solutions must be secured under the firewall</li>
<li><strong>No <em>BS</em></strong>: no hallucinations or unexplained results. Every answer can be explained and backed by a reference</li>
<li><strong>No Test Gaps</strong>: test for robustness, fairness, and bias, data leakage or toxicity. Being able to prove these tests to customers and regulators</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>amazed</strong> and <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the potential of LLMs in the medical field. The possibilities are limitless.</p>
