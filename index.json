Time to MLOps"},{"content":"I attended last week the Medical Large Language Models for Clinical Text Summarization, Information Extraction, and Question Answering from John Snow Labs. I\u0026rsquo;m sharing my notes here.\nLLMs LLMs and NLP in general are providing new tools to solve existing problems in healthcare. Here is a list of some new tools that are available today:\nQuestion Answering Text Summarization Text Generation Information extraction (e.g. from clinical notes) Relation extraction (e.g. symptoms related to a disease) Entity recognition (like ICD-10 code extraction) Chatbots Many open source LLMs available today have close performance to the best commercial state-of-the-art models, like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo form OpenAI or Claude from Anthropic. The last tend to be general purpose, powerful, but extremely expensive to train. The open source models tend to lack performance in a broad sense but can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. This field is moving fast, which means that there is much potential for innovation, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a challenge to keep up with the state-of-the-art.\nHere is an overview of tasks that Medical LLMs can perform today:\nLLMs in Healthcare 1. Close book Q\u0026amp;A: Question answering using BioGPT JSL as the base model and a knowledge base.\ndemo available here: https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/MEDICAL_LLM/\n2. Medical text generation BioGPT JSL can also be used to generate text, like an elaborate response to a more open question, creating synthetic text or even synthetic patients. Demo available here: https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/MEDICAL_LLM/\n(nice implementation with streamlit btw)\n3. Clinical text Summarization One of the most popular uses of LLMs in medical field is clinical summarization. An obvious use case is to summarize a patient\u0026rsquo;s medical history, since it can get very long and have repeated information. This summarization has its own specificities, like the need to preserve the medical terminology and the need to preserve the order of events.\ndemo available here: https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/MEDICAL_LLM/\n4. Biomedical Research text Summarization A tool to help dealing with the avalanche of new research papers that are being published. It makes it easier to automate the process of reading and summarizing the papers.\n5. Patient Question text Summarization A way to outline the patient\u0026rsquo;s question to the doctor, so that the doctor can quickly understand the patient\u0026rsquo;s concern.\nNo-Code Medical Chatbots Another interesting concept is no-code implementations that JSL are developing, available at https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/nlp-lab/.\nIt can be used to create natural language interfaces to query databases, of both clinical records and biomedical research.\nThis seems very interesting to apply in a Business Intelligence + healthcare context. The user could help accelarate the adoption of BI practices in the field and make it more widespread.\nThree key requirements were proposed to comply these chatbots with current regulations (like new legislation that is being currently discussed in EU parliament).\nNo Data Sharing: Clinical data is sensitive. No data is shared through cloud, APIs and 3rd parties. Solutions must be secured under the firewall No BS: no hallucinations or unexplained results. Every answer can be explained and backed by a reference No Test Gaps: test for robustness, fairness, and bias, data leakage or toxicity. Being able to prove these tests to customers and regulators I\u0026rsquo;m amazed and overwhelmed by the potential of LLMs in the medical field. The possibilities are limitless.\nThe vod of the webcast can be found here: https://www.carahsoft.com/learn/event/45747-medical-large-language-models-for-clinical-text-summarization-information-extraction-and-question-answering\n","permalink":"https://diogocarapito.com/posts/6_medical_llms/","summary":"I attended last week the Medical Large Language Models for Clinical Text Summarization, Information Extraction, and Question Answering from John Snow Labs.

It was a great event with a lot of interesting talks. I’ll share some of my key takeaways.\n1. Best practices when developing NLP models Presented in the opening keynote by Dr. David Gondek, Chief Data Scientist at John Snow Labs, he sumarized some best practices that i found interesting as I’m beginning my NLP journey:\nTest your models! - why would you expect untested software to work? Test your models with real data and real use cases and assess it’s performance. Don’t reuse academic models in production - published research ≠ building reliable systems, testing and fine-tuning are essencial parts of developing a functional tool. Test beyond accuracy - Test for Robustness, Bias, Fairness, Toxicity, Efficiency, Safety. John Snow Labs developed NLP test to help with model testing beyond regular benchmarks. 2. Mitigating bias in healthcare language models Gaurav Kaushik from ScienceIO presented a talk about mitigating bias in healthcare language models and the importance of its evaluation. Performance benchmarks lack the statistical power, they aren’t well validated enough and don’t incentivize the use of biased systems.\nAlgorithmic bias Systematic and repeatable errors that yield unfair outcomes which benefit certain groups over others Healthcare LP systems will influence clinical outcomes and therefore will mitigate or exacerbate outcome disparities Selection Bias - data used in training the model does not represent real-world Label bias - mismatch between annotations and target, e.g. due to judgement, human error, or label ambiguity Training bias - models amplify biases in the training data Semantic bias - bias from input representations such as inappropriate word associations Demographic bias - improper sensitivity to race or gender, or impaired performance on attributes related to subgroups Domain Bias - error bias in medical subdomains, such as disease areas, which can impair generalization Check this article for further information: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList\n3. Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction Betty van Aken from DATEXIS Research Group presented a language model that makes predictions based on parts of the text that are similar to prototypical patients providing justifications that doctors understand. It uses a prototypical network with label-wise attention to find the most similar patients to the input text and then uses a transformer to predict the diagnosis. This is a great example of how NLP can be used in healthcare space and opens the door to a lot of interesting applications.\nCheck their demo and the paper here: This Patient Looks Like That Patient: Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Text\n4. EHR-Safe: Generating High-Fidelity and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Records AI in healthcare has important privacy concerns, especially when dealing with sensitive data like Electronic Health Records (EHR). Cloud AI Team suggested that one way to overcome this challenge is to generate high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic EHR data. They proposed a generative modeling framework, EHR-Safe, that can generate highly realistic synthetic EHR data that are robust against privacy attacks.\nCheck their paper here: EHR-Safe: Generating high-fidelity and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records\n5. Some organizations that are doing interesting work in NLP in healthcare: John Snow Labs - organizer of the summit and creator of state-of-the-art NLP in healthcare, like NLP test and SparkNLP Discovery Lab - Lab funded by Elsevier, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam that operates at the crossroads of Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. NeuralMed - a healthcare AI company that develops AI solutions for the healthcare industry. Science IO - transforms medical text into enriched data to build solutions that improve patient care. DATEXIS - Data Science and Text-based Information Systems (DATEXIS) group at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin This is a list of some interesting projects that were presented at the summit:\nSpark NLP - an open source text processing library for Python, Java, and Scala. NLP test - a suit of tests to help mitigate bias for NLP models. BioMedLM - a GPT style language model trained on biomedical abstracts and papers. BioGPT - a pre-trained language models on the biomedical domain. ProtoPatient Demo - diagnostic predictions using clinical text and prototypical patients. Clinical IE - a Large Language Model for information extraction of Clinical Text Finally, I’ll share some of the articles that were cited in the talks:\nDataset Carto graphy: Mapping and Diagnosing Datasets with Training Dynamics Five sources of bias in natural language processing Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList Quantifying Social Biases in NLP: A Generalization and Empirical Comparison of Extrinsic Fairness Metrics TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods This Patient Looks Like That Patient: Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Text Physician Global Assessment (PGA) EHR-Safe: Generating High-Fidelity and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Records Open AI Fine-tuning guide There were many more interesting sessions I didn’t describe here, visit https://www.nlpsummit.org/ if you want further information.

The frontend must:\nuse Pyhton as main language have a fast learning curve and easy development produce a clean, intuitive and beautiful tool I started with Flask/Dash vs Django, and after some thought, since I have built with it before, I picked Dash.
