They both look sleek and simple. And both are made with hugo. So i dug in.\nHugo seems to be a static site generator, that uses markdown files to generate html pages. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, it\u0026rsquo;s simple, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to use.\nEven though the setting up part was not that easy as promised (why can everything work like python?), I ended up with a better looking site. I\u0026rsquo;t seems customizable enough to fuss arround in the future if i need.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll have some news soon, since i\u0026rsquo;ve already delivering my project on Predictive Methods of Data Mining @NOVA IMS. I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching seminars/conferences on youtube regarding MLops ans LLMs and i\u0026rsquo;m exited to share some of my thoughts.\nlets publish this and see if it works ;)\nBtw, thanks david hwang for your tutorial on publishing with gihub pages.\n","permalink":"https://diogocarapito.com/posts/hugo/","summary":"Last time I posted a blog post I went nuts to make it work.

It was a great event with a lot of interesting talks. I’ll share some of my key takeaways.\n1. Best practices when developing NLP models Presented in the opening keynote by Dr. David Gondek, Chief Data Scientist at John Snow Labs, he sumarized some best practices that i found interesting as I’m beginning my NLP journey:\nTest your models! - why would you expect untested software to work? Test your models with real data and real use cases and acess it’s performance. Don’t reuse academic models in production - published research ≠ building reliable systems, testing and fine-tuning are essencial parts of developing a functional tool. Test beyond accuracy - Test for Rubustness, Bias, Fairness, Toxicity, Efficiency, Safety. John Snow Labs developed NLP test to help with model testing beyond regular benchmarks. 2. Mitigating bias in healthcare language models Gaurav Kaushik from ScienceIO presented a talk about mitigating bias in healthcare language models and the importance of it’s evaluation. Performance benchmarks lack the statistical power, they aren’t well validated enough and don’t deincentivize the use of biased systems.\nAlgorithmic bias Systematic and repeatable errors that yield unfair outcomes which benefit certain groups over others Healthcare LP systems will influence clinical outcomes and therefore will mitigate or exacerbate outcome disparities Selection Bias - data used in training the model does not represent real-world Label bias - mismatch between annotations and target, e.g. due to judgement, human error, or label ambiguity Training bias - models amplify biases in the training data Semantic bias - bias from input representations such as inappropriate word associations Demographic bias - improper sensitivity to race or gender, or impaired performance on attributes related to subgroups Domain Bias - error bias in medical subdomains, such as disease areas, which can impair generalization Check this article for further information: Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList\n3. Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction Betty van Aken from DATEXIS Research Group presented about a language model that makes predictions based on parts of the text that are similar to prototypical patients providing justifications that doctors understand. It uses a prototypical network with label-wise attention to find the most similar patients to the input text and then uses a transformer to predict the diagnosis. This is a great example of how NLP can be used in healthcare space and opens the door to a lot of interesting applications.\nCheck their demo and the paper here: This Patient Looks Like That Patient: Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Text\n4. EHR-Safe: Generating High-Fidelity and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Records AI in healthcare has important privacy concerns, especially when dealing with sensitive data like Eletronic Health Records (EHR). Cloud AI Team presented one way to overcome this challenges is to generating high-fidelity, privacy-preserving synthetic HR data. They propose generative modeling framework, EHR-Safe, that can generate highly realistic synthetic EHR data that are robust to privacy attacks.\nCheck their paper here: EHR-Safe: Generating high-fidelity and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records\n5. Some organizations that are doing interesting work in NLP in healthcare: John Snow Labs - organizer of the summit and creator of state-of-the-art NLP in healthcare, like NLP test and SparkNLP Discovery Lab - Lab funded by Elsevier, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam that operates at the crossroads of Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. NeuralMed - an healthcare AI company that develops AI solutions for the healthcare industry. Science IO - works on medical text into enriched data to build solutions that improve patient care. DATEXIS - Data Science and Text-based Information Systems (DATEXIS) group at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin This is a list of some interesting projects that were presented at the summit:\nSpark NLP - an open source text processing library for Python, Java, and Scala. NLP test - a suit of tests to mitigating bias for NLP models. BioMedLM - a GPT style language model trained on biomedical abstracts and papers. BioGPT - a pre-trained language models on the biomedical domain. ProtoPatient Demo - diagnsotic predictions using clinical text and prototypical patients. Clinical IE - a Large Language Model for information extraction of Clinical Text Finally, I’ll share some of the articles that were cited in the talks:\nDataset Carto graphy: Mapping and Diagnosing Datasets with Training Dynamics Five sources of bias in natural language processing Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList Quantifying Social Biases in NLP: A Generalization and Empirical Comparison of Extrinsic Fairness Metrics TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods This Patient Looks Like That Patient: Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Text Physician Global Assessment (PGA) EHR-Safe: Generating High-Fidelity and Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Records Open AI Fine-tuning guide There were many more interesting sessions I didn’t describe here, visit https://www.nlpsummit.org/ if you want further information. I’ll be there next year for sure! Thanks for reading!\nPS: Copilot helped writing this blog post.

I have this NLP project cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.\nFor the backend I’ve been cruising through Pinecone, LangChain and OpenAI API, thanks to tutorials form James Briggs and Data independent. Google colab has been my best friend.\nEven though the backend is the new exiting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented. The frontend must:\nuse Pyhton as main language have a fast learning curve and easy development produce a clean, intuitive and beautiful tool I started with Flask/Dash vs Django, and after some thought, since i have built with it before, I picked Dash. I ended up building a scafold, the development was faster this time arround but it required some hardcode. The result was OK but not stunning. Dash is pretty taxing on layout and design. I deployed it on render (that was a first :smile:)\nLast night I discovered Streamlit. I was captivated by it’s beauty and simplicity and ended up creating a simple scafolding witht he help of Fanilo, Misra Turp and Coding Is Fun tutorials.\nThis morning I stumbled again on Pynecone (different pinecone) and I was amazed (thanks to NeuralNine’s video), it seem to a have all I need for my simple implementation. It’s on alpha stage, but I guess I’ll give it a try.\nIf that wasn’t enought, it seems that FastAPI can also serve as a framework for a webapp. This will be fun…\nI’m not sure what framework will I end up with. Let’s keep going!\nSome stuff I found useful this week:\nemoji cheat sheet - emoji code list https://cssgradient.io/ - tool to create gradients Data Color Picker - Palette, Single Hue and Divergent color generators ","permalink":"https://diogocarapito.com/posts/webapps_and_tutorials/","summary":"This week has been exiting.

Initially I thought implementing a blog with Dash and publish it on pythonanywhere.com, since I’ve worked with Flask in the past months. But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.\nDuring fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about fastpages, but seems that the project has been discontinued.\nI found REPL Notes, it had a pretty and simple solution. It seems that the paid version wasn’t functioning right and it was too strict for personalization.\nI ended up with fastpages’ sucessor quatro.org. It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap). It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available. cool B-)\nThat’s what I appreciate most: eficient implementation and task automation that saves time.\nI’m super exited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!).
