      <description>Last time I posted a blog post I went nuts to make it work. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember how to publish a post. I don&amp;rsquo;t what it was, maybe guithub pages, maybe the quarto framework, but defenitly my dumbness was a big part of it. I just can&amp;rsquo;t grasp yet how all this unintuitive git shenanigans works. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been postponing my new blog post knowing what awaited me.
Meanwhile, I remembered a friend of mine Inês Pereira had a blog with the same pourpouse, and it crossed my eyes another blog https://notadoctor.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that mgfhub.com is now live!
It&amp;rsquo;s as a sort of &amp;ldquo;data visualization &amp;quot; for KPI&amp;rsquo;s (indicadores) in Portuguese Primary Care. I imagined it for more than a year, and it&amp;rsquo;s trying to answer questions that I have in my day to day work:
How many do exist?
How do this KPI&amp;rsquo;s work
How to find specific KPI&amp;rsquo;s (eg: which are related to diabetes?)
What&amp;rsquo;s the impact of each KPI in the main performance index (IDG)?</description>

      <description>This week I attended the NLP Summit Healthcare 2023, a free virtual event organized by the John Snow Labs. It was a great event with a lot of interesting talks. I’ll share some of my key takeaways.
1. Best practices when developing NLP models Presented in the opening keynote by Dr. David Gondek, Chief Data Scientist at John Snow Labs, he sumarized some best practices that i found interesting as I’m beginning my NLP journey:</description>

      <description>This week has been exiting. I have this NLP project cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.
For the backend I’ve been cruising through Pinecone, LangChain and OpenAI API, thanks to tutorials form James Briggs and Data independent. Google colab has been my best friend.
Even though the backend is the new exiting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented.</description>

      <description>I’ve been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between health and tech (NLP and LLMs, I’m looking at you). There is so much potential and I have so many ideas!
So, lately I’ve been:
grinding through fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders (just finished the 4th lesson this week) exploring website domain name stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPI’s exploration tool, mgfhub.</description>
